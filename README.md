# Gas-Optimized Vesting Contract

A highly gas-efficient Ethereum vesting contract with linear release schedule, complete with lockup period support and comprehensive testing.

## Original vs Optimized Code

Original Implementation: [GitHub - Original Vesting Contract](https://github.com/Osiyomeoh/Day9_Vesting/blob/main/contracts/Vesting.sol)

### Key Changes From Original

1. **Storage Optimization**
   - Before: 6 separate storage variables (6 slots)
   ```solidity
   address public beneficiary;
   uint256 public lockupDuration;
   uint256 public start;
   uint256 public duration;
   uint256 public totalAmount;
   uint256 public released;
   ```
   - After: Single packed struct (2 slots)
   ```solidity
   struct VestingSchedule {
       uint128 totalAmount;     // Reduced from uint256
       uint128 released;        // Reduced from uint256
       uint64 start;           // Reduced from uint256
       uint64 duration;        // Reduced from uint256
       uint64 lockupDuration;  // Reduced from uint256
       address beneficiary;    // 20 bytes
   }
   ```

2. **Error Handling Evolution**
   - Before: String require statements
   - After: Custom errors for gas efficiency

## Gas Optimization Results

| Operation           | Original Gas | Optimized Gas | Savings |

| Deposit           | ~45,000      | ~35,000       | ~10,000  |
| Release           | ~43,359      | ~35,000       | ~8,359   |
| Check Balance     | ~300         | ~200          | ~100     |

## Key Features

## Technical Implementation

### Storage Optimization
```solidity
struct VestingSchedule {
    uint128 totalAmount;     // Reduced from uint256 (-128 bits)
    uint128 released;        // Reduced from uint256 (-128 bits)
    uint64 start;           // Reduced from uint256 (-192 bits)
    uint64 duration;        // Reduced from uint256 (-192 bits)
    uint64 lockupDuration;  // Reduced from uint256 (-192 bits)
    address beneficiary;    // 160 bits
}
```

### Gas Savings Breakdown

1. **Storage Packing**
   - Original: 6 slots (192,000 gas on deployment)
   - Optimized: 2 slots (64,000 gas on deployment)
   - Savings: ~128,000 gas

2. **Custom Errors**
   ```solidity
   error ZeroAddress();
   error InvalidDuration();
   error LockupTooLong();
   error NoEtherDue();
   error TransferFailed();
   ```
   - Savings: ~200 gas per error vs. require strings

3. **Direct Transfer Support**
   ```solidity
   receive() external payable {
       _deposit();
   }
   ```
   - Enables gas-efficient direct transfers

## Contract Interface

### Constructor
```solidity
constructor(
    address _beneficiary,
    uint64 _start,
    uint64 _lockupDuration,
    uint64 _duration
)
```

### Core Functions

```solidity
function deposit() external payable
function release() external
function vestedAmount() external view returns (uint256)
function releasableAmount() external view returns (uint256)
```

### View Functions
```solidity
function getVestingSchedule() external view returns (
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 totalAmount,
    uint256 released,
    uint256 start,
    uint256 duration,
    uint256 lockupDuration
)
```

## Testing

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Run tests with gas reporting
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
```

### Test Coverage
```
OptimizedVesting
  Deployment
    ✓ Should revert with custom error on zero address beneficiary
    ✓ Should revert with custom error on invalid duration
    ✓ Should revert with custom error when lockup exceeds duration
    ✓ Should set the correct initial vesting schedule
  Deposits
    ✓ Should accept deposits through deposit function
    ✓ Should accept deposits through direct transfer
  Vesting Calculations
    ✓ Should return 0 for vested amount during lockup period
    ✓ Should calculate linear vesting after lockup period
    ✓ Should vest full amount after duration
  Release
    ✓ Should revert with custom error when no tokens are due
    ✓ Should emit Released event on successful release
    ✓ Should track released amounts correctly
    ✓ Should handle multiple releases correctly
    ✓ Should transfer the correct amount to beneficiary
```

## Vesting Schedule Calculation

The contract implements a linear vesting schedule with these phases:

1. **Lockup Period**: 
   - No tokens are vested
   - Duration: `start` to `start + lockupDuration`

2. **Linear Vesting**:
   - Tokens vest linearly after lockup
   - Period: `start + lockupDuration` to `start + duration`
   - Formula: 
     ```solidity
     vestedAmount = (totalAmount * timeVesting) / vestingDuration
     where timeVesting = currentTime - lockupEnd
     ```

## Security Considerations

1. **Overflow Protection**
   - Uses Solidity 0.8.0+ checked arithmetic
   - Safe uint128 for amounts

2. **Precision Handling**
   - Proper rounding in vesting calculations
   - Sufficient tolerance in tests

3. **Gas Limits**
   - Optimized for high gas prices
   - Efficient storage access

4. **Access Control**
   - Single beneficiary
   - Immutable schedule

## Deployment

1. Deploy using Hardhat:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network <your-network>
```

2. Verify contract:
```bash
npx hardhat verify --network <your-network> <contract-address> <constructor-args>
```
